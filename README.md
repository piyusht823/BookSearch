# BookSearch
For this assignment, I was tasked to create a React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
