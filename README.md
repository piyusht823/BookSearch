# BookSearch
For this assignment, I was tasked to create a React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

Access the deployed Heroku app here: https://react-google-book-search-clb20.herokuapp.com/

# Installation
Since this is hosted on Heroku, there is no installation required however, if you want to clone or fork my github repo, feel free to do so. You will need to run a few commands in the terminal:

npm i
npm run build
npm start (this application is built to run locally on port 3000, which can be changed in server.js)
You can also build your own vanilla React app by running npx create-react-app APP_NAME in your terminal. (Replace APP_NAME with your app name.)
